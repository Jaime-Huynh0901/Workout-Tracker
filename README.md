# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

The goal was to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day using  APIs. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. This app uses the Moment.js library in the browser to work with date and time. Moment.js library allows you to parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript.

This Work Day Scheduler is aimed towards employees with a busy schedule who want to add important events to a daily planner so that they can manage their time effectively.

i. Fork the Github repository.
ii. Clone the forked repo into your local machine using gitbash/terminal to pull the project and data.
iii. Access the index.html, style.css and script.js files and assets via Visual Studio or in your browser to view the code and website respectively.  
iv. Open and explore the planner.

```

## Usage
jQuery Components Used:
```bash
Moment.js library - functions - DOM methods - window object - jquery selectors - jquery callbacks - append - timers - event delegation - JSON - client-side storage 
```


## Key Checks Included ensuring the following:
Given user is using a daily planner to create a schedule:
1. When user opens the planner, then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
2. When user scrolls down, then user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
3. When user views the timeblocks for that day, then each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
4. When user clicks into a timeblock, then user can enter an event
5. When user clicks the save button for that timeblock, then text for that event is saved in local storage
6. When user refreshes the page, then the saved events persist
